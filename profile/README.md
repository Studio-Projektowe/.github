# Welcome 👋! 

This organization is the collaborative workspace for our "Project Studio 1" university course. 
Our MissionOur primary goal is to research, implement, and analyze robust face recognition models designed to handle partial occlusion. 
We are exploring how state-of-the-art architectures (like ResNet) and loss functions (like ArcFace) perform when identifying faces obscured by masks, sunglasses, or scarves.T
his project is hosted here as a central hub for our code, research, and documentation.

## 👩‍💻 Our Project

This organization hosts all the artifacts related to our project. [Face-recognition-with-occlusion](https://github.com/Studio-Projektowe/Face-recognition-with-occlusion).
A project comparing deep learning models (e.g., fine-tuned VGGFace) for robust face identification on synthetically occluded datasets (masks, sunglasses).
This is our main repository containing:The Python/Keras implementation of our models (VGGFace fine-tuning, ArcFace, etc.).
Data augmentation scripts for applying synthetic occlusion.Evaluation scripts and metric analysis.
Our final LaTeX report and presentation slides
